# Vehicle Rental

## The Challenge

Rent different kinds of vehicles such as cars and bikes.

## Features:

- Rental service has multiple branches throughout the city.
- Each branch has a limited number of different kinds of vehicles.
- Each vehicle can be booked with a predefined fixed price.
- Each vehicle can be booked in multiples of 1-hour slots each. (For simplicity, assume slots of a single day)

## Requirements:

- Onboard a new branch with available vehicles.
- Onboard new vehicle(s) of an existing type to a particular branch.
- Rent a vehicle for a time slot and a vehicle type(the lowest price as the default choice extendable to any other strategy).
- Display available vehicles for a given branch sorted on price.
- The vehicle will have to be dropped at the same branch where it was picked up.
- Bonus question:
Dynamic pricing – demand vs supply. If 80% of cars in a particular branch are booked, increase the price by 10%.

## Input and Output scenarios:
```
COMMAND	OUTPUT	DESCRIPTION
ADD_BRANCH	TRUE if the operation succeeds else FALSE	onboard branch (Branch Name, Vehicle Type)
ADD_VEHICLE	TRUE if the operation succeeds else FALSE	onboard vehicle - (Branch Name, Vehicle Type, vehicle id, price)
BOOK	Booking Price, if booking succeeds else -1	book a vehicle - (Branch id, vehicle type, start time, end time)
DISPLAY_VEHICLES	Vehicle Ids, comma-separated	display all available vehicles for a branch, sorted on price ( Branch id, start time, end time )
```

```
SAMPLE INPUT-OUTPUT 1
INPUT	OUTPUT
ADD_BRANCH B1 CAR,BIKE,VAN	TRUE
ADD_VEHICLE B1 CAR V1 500	TRUE
ADD_VEHICLE B1 CAR V2 1000	TRUE
ADD_VEHICLE B1 BIKE V3 250	TRUE
ADD_VEHICLE B1 BIKE V4 300	TRUE
ADD_VEHICLE B1 BUS V5 2500	FALSE
BOOK B1 VAN 1 5	-1
BOOK B1 CAR 1 3	1000
BOOK B1 BIKE 2 3	250
BOOK B1 BIKE 2 5	900
DISPLAY_VEHICLES B1 1 5	V2
```

## Other Details:

- Use the in-memory store.
- Do not create any UI for the application.
- Write a driver class for demo purposes. Which will execute all the commands in one place in the code and test cases.
- Please prioritize code compilation, execution, and completion.
- Work on the expected output first and then add good-to-have features of your own.

## Expectations:

- Make sure that you can execute your code and show that it is working.
- Make sure that the code is functionally correct.
- Work on the expected output first and then add good-to-have features of your own.
- Code should be modular and readable.
- Separation of concern should be addressed.
- Code should easily accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
- Code should be easily testable.
- Input can be taken in your desired format[not necessary to follow the same grammar], but the API’s should remain as is(should contain all the input params)


## Things to keep in mind while submitting the code:

- Coding solution should be in Java.
- Working code is required.
- Code is evaluated for proper domain modeling and design, need not be optimized.
- Separation of concerns must be taken care.
- Solution should be extensible.
- Writing all the necessary Unit tests is expected.
- Necessary design patterns must be implemented.
- Naming variable conventions.
- Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console. Your program should execute and take the location to the test file as a parameter.
