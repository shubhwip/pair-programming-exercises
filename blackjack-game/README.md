# BlackJack Game

Popular BlackJack Game is designed in Object-Oriented Fashion.

## IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS

- We can have a common object for player and dealer and define an member variable as a role which will
differentiate between the player and the dealer.
Pros : Simpler and more consistent
Cons : It will increase time complexity in the system as at many places we need to put a check if a player
is a dealer.

- Create a Objects Diagram

- Write Tests Tomorrow

- Factory Pattern, Dependency Injection Pattern.

- Dealer Operations are fixed so automate it.

- Game is run in one pass.
